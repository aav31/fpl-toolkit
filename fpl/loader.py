"""
This module defines the Loader class, which provides methods to fetch data from the FPL API.
For more information on different API endpoints a useful article is:
https://medium.com/@frenzelts/fantasy-premier-league-api-endpoints-a-detailed-guide-acbd5598eb19

Available functions:
- get_static_info: Return the static information from the FPL API.
- get_fixtures: Return a list of fixtures from the FPL API.
- get_fixture_info: Return the information for a particular fixture.
- get_fixtures_for_gameweek: Return the fixtures from FPL for a particular gameweek.
- get_team_basic_info: Return the information for a particular team given their team id.
- get_my_team: Get team information of current fpl team either from the api or locally.
- get_next_gameweek: Get the id of the next gameweek as an integer as of a particular UTC timestamp.
- get_my_historical_team_from_gameweek: Returns the historical team a manager used for a particular gameweek.
- get_player_basic_info: Get the basic information of a player so far this season and based on the most recent gameweek.
- get_player_detailed_info: Returns a playerâ€™s detailed information.
- get_player_historical_info_for_gameweek: Return a player's information for a particular gameweek where the information is known.
- get_player_future_info_for_gameweek: Return a player's information for a particular gameweek where the information is unknown.
- get_position_info: Get the information regarding a particular position.
- find_matching_players: Search for players whose web names partially match the search_name using fuzzy matching.
