    "## Expected Points Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the framework of [General Model Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mapping - what phenomena are we trying to model?\n",
    "Given that a player plays a particular fixture (greater than zero minutes played), we want to model how many points the player will score.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reduction - what simplifying assumptions will we make?\n",
    "The simplifying assumptions we will make are as follows:\n",
    "- Points scored depends only on fixture difficulty, form and points per game (again, only games where a player plays more than zero minutes)\n",
    "- There will be no attempt to estimate minutes of each player or likelihood of playing; the effect of minutes will come indirectly through points per game\n",
    "- There will be no attempt to use other useful statistics from other data sources such as betting odds, opta data, xG etc\n",
    "- We will restrict our data for analysis to gameweeks 20-24 so that averages are not calculated over so few gameweeks\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pragmatism - when can we use the model from a practical point of view?\n",
    "We can use this model if, for each fixture each player plays, we can calculate:\n",
    "1. Their points per game so far that season, prior to the fixture.\n",
    "2. Their form so far than season prior to the fixture.\n",
    "3. An indication of the difficulty of a particular fixture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be relatively simple, therefore we can create an `ExpectedPointsCalculator` from such a model and plug it into our `Optimizer`."
